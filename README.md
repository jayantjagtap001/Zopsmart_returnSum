1. Sum Function
A JavaScript function implemented to support chained calls like sum(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)() which returns the sum of all inputs.

Features
Accepts integers through chained calls.
Calculates the sum dynamically and returns the result when () is invoked.
Fully functional as a standalone JavaScript feature.

2. Traffic Light Simulation
A React component that simulates a traffic light with three bulbs (red, yellow, green) changing sequentially.

Features
Realistic traffic light format with circular lights.
Color transition follows this sequence:
Green → Yellow (after 3 seconds)
Yellow → Red (after 2 seconds)
Red → Green (after 4 seconds)
Lights repeat the sequence indefinitely.

🛠️ Technologies Used
React: For the traffic light component.
JavaScript: For the sum function logic.
CSS: For traffic light styling and smooth transitions.
